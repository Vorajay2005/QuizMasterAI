Biology Chapter 12: Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

Key Components:
- Chloroplasts: Organelles where photosynthesis occurs
- Chlorophyll: Green pigment that captures light energy
- Carbon dioxide: Gas absorbed from the atmosphere
- Water: Absorbed through roots

The Process:
1. Light Dependent Reactions: Occur in the thylakoids
   - Water is split (photolysis)
   - Oxygen is released
   - ATP and NADPH are produced

2. Light Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle): Occur in the stroma
   - CO2 is fixed into organic molecules
   - Uses ATP and NADPH from light reactions
   - Produces glucose

Chemical Equation: 
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy ‚Üí C6H12O6 + 6O2

Factors affecting photosynthesis:
- Light intensity
- Temperature  
- Carbon dioxide concentration
- Water availability

Importance:
- Produces oxygen for atmosphere
- Foundation of food chains
- Removes CO2 from atmosphere

  chemistry: `
Chemistry Chapter 4: Chemical Bonding

Types of Chemical Bonds:

1. Ionic Bonds
- Form between metals and non-metals
- Transfer of electrons
- Form crystalline structures
- Example: NaCl (sodium chloride)

2. Covalent Bonds
- Form between non-metals
- Sharing of electrons
- Can be polar or nonpolar
- Example: H2O (water)

3. Metallic Bonds
- Form between metal atoms
- Sea of delocalized electrons
- Explains conductivity and malleability

Bond Properties:
- Bond length: Distance between nuclei
- Bond strength: Energy required to break bond
- Bond polarity: Unequal sharing of electrons

Molecular Geometry:
- VSEPR theory predicts molecular shapes
- Common shapes: linear, bent, tetrahedral, pyramidal

Intermolecular Forces:
- Van der Waals forces
- Hydrogen bonding
- Dipole-dipole interactions

  physics: `
Physics Chapter 2: Motion and Forces

Newton's Laws of Motion:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia)
- An object at rest stays at rest
- An object in motion stays in motion
- Unless acted upon by external force

2. Second Law
- F = ma (Force = mass √ó acceleration)
- Force is directly proportional to acceleration
- Inversely proportional to mass

3. Third Law
- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
- Forces always occur in pairs

Types of Forces:
- Gravitational force: F = mg
- Friction force: opposes motion
- Normal force: perpendicular to surface
- Applied force: external push or pull

Motion Equations:
- v = u + at (velocity)
- s = ut + ¬Ωat¬≤ (displacement)
- v¬≤ = u¬≤ + 2as (velocity-displacement)

Where:
- v = final velocity
- u = initial velocity
- a = acceleration
- t = time
- s = displacement
