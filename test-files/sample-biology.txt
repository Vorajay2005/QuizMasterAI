Introduction to Cell Biology

The cell is the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This fundamental principle is known as the cell theory.

Cell Structure:
- Cell membrane: Controls what enters and exits the cell
- Nucleus: Contains the cell's DNA and controls cellular activities
- Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance where cellular processes occur
- Mitochondria: Powerhouses of the cell that produce ATP
- Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis

Cell Division:
Cells reproduce through a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells, this occurs through mitosis, which results in two identical daughter cells.

The cell cycle consists of:
1. G1 phase: Cell growth and normal functions
2. S phase: DNA replication
3. G2 phase: Preparation for division
4. M phase: Mitosis and cytokinesis

Understanding cellular processes is crucial for comprehending how life functions at the most basic level.
