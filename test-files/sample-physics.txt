Newton's Laws of Motion

Sir Isaac Newton formulated three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between forces acting on a body and its motion. These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics.

First Law (Law of Inertia):
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

This law introduces the concept of inertia - the tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion.

Second Law (F = ma):
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

Mathematically: F = ma
Where:
- F = net force (Newtons)
- m = mass (kilograms)  
- a = acceleration (m/sÂ²)

Third Law (Action-Reaction):
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

Applications:
- Walking: We push backward on the ground, and the ground pushes forward on us
- Rocket propulsion: Hot gases are expelled downward, pushing the rocket upward
- Swimming: We push water backward, and water pushes us forward

These laws apply to all objects, from subatomic particles to planets, making them universal principles of physics.
