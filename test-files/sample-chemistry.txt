Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

Chemical bonds are the forces that hold atoms together in molecules and compounds. Understanding these bonds is essential for predicting molecular behavior and properties.

Types of Chemical Bonds:

1. Ionic Bonds:
- Formed between metals and non-metals
- Involve complete transfer of electrons
- Result in charged ions (cations and anions)
- Example: NaCl (sodium chloride)

2. Covalent Bonds:
- Formed between non-metal atoms
- Involve sharing of electron pairs
- Can be single, double, or triple bonds
- Example: H2O (water), CO2 (carbon dioxide)

3. Metallic Bonds:
- Found in metals
- Electrons form a "sea" around metal cations
- Responsible for properties like conductivity and malleability

Molecular Geometry:
The shape of molecules is determined by the arrangement of electron pairs around the central atom. VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory helps predict molecular shapes.

Common molecular geometries include:
- Linear (180°)
- Trigonal planar (120°)
- Tetrahedral (109.5°)
- Trigonal bipyramidal (90° and 120°)
- Octahedral (90°)
