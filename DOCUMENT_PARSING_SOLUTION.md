# Document Parsing Solution - Fixed Quiz Generation

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

The issue was that the application couldn't properly read and process PDF, DOC, and DOCX files for quiz generation. The original implementation used `FileReader.readAsText()` which only works for plain text files, resulting in garbled content for binary document formats.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Document Parser Service (`server/services/documentParser.js`)

- **PDF Support**: Uses `pdf-parse` library to extract text from PDF files
- **Word Document Support**: Uses `mammoth` library to extract text from .doc and .docx files
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes control characters and normalizes whitespace
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes document structure, difficulty, and key terms
- **Smart Content Extraction**: Prioritizes important paragraphs for quiz generation

### 2. Enhanced OpenAI Service (`server/services/openaiService.js`)

- **Improved Topic Detection**: Weighted keyword scoring system for accurate subject identification
- **Enhanced Question Generation**: Better content analysis and fact extraction
- **Contextual Distractors**: Generates more relevant wrong answers for MCQ questions
- **Content-Aware Processing**: Analyzes sentence patterns, definitions, and key concepts

### 3. New Upload Route (`/api/quiz/upload-document`)

- Handles file uploads up to 10MB
- Supports .txt, .md, .pdf, .doc, .docx files
- Returns parsed content with analysis and topic detection
- Provides detailed error handling

### 4. Updated Frontend (`client/src/pages/CreateQuiz.jsx`)

- Automatic document parsing for binary files
- Auto-fills subject and difficulty based on analysis
- Enhanced loading states with progress indicators
- Better error handling and user feedback

## How to Use

1. **Upload Document**: Drag and drop or select PDF, DOC, or DOCX files
2. **Automatic Processing**: System extracts text and analyzes content
3. **Topic Detection**: AI identifies the subject matter automatically
4. **Quiz Configuration**: Adjust settings or use auto-detected values
5. **Generate Quiz**: Create accurate, content-based questions

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added

```bash
npm install mammoth pdf-parse multer
```

### Key Files Modified

- `server/services/documentParser.js` (new)
- `server/services/openaiService.js` (enhanced)
- `server/routes/quiz.js` (added upload route)
- `client/src/pages/CreateQuiz.jsx` (enhanced upload)

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/quiz/upload-document` - Parse uploaded documents
- `POST /api/quiz/generate` - Generate quiz from content (existing, enhanced)

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Content Reading**: Properly extracts text from all supported formats
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Understands document structure and key concepts
3. **Relevant Questions**: Generates questions directly from document content
4. **Better User Experience**: Seamless upload and processing workflow
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Clear feedback for unsupported files or errors

The document parsing system now works reliably with PDF, DOC, and DOCX files, generating accurate and relevant quiz questions based on the actual content of uploaded documents.
